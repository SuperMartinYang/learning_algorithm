This is a storage covert channel. Sending message by test whether there exists PATH file.

	sender		receiver

PATH	  W		   R

SECRET	  R

So when sender get information from secret, it will create PATH file to represent 1, and delete PATH file to represend 0

The receiver will test whether PATH file exists, if it is, it will get 1, if not, it will get 0

When the sender send "%$" means start message, and "$%" means end of message.

When receiver get "$%", it will create a STOP file, and stop to receive message.
