sol_1: worst
sol_2: using extend to connect two lists
sol_3: inner_product: use DP
sol_4: count_frequency: use dict
sol_5: get_words_from_string: use string.translate to split words
sol_6: change insertion_sort into merge_sort (recursive, sort, merge, divide and conquer)
sol_7: fully use dictionary, without using sort. no need, sort just help quicker computer inner product, but use dict, array mode hash will be quicker
       without go through the list each time
sol_8: treat whole file as a line, rather than line by line
